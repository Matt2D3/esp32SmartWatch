to add a feature, you must have
#used to select desired screen
if curScreen == "SCREEN NAME HERE":
  while GUIUPDATE == False:
  
  
    #code here
    
    #background task must be called when a feature is idle to ensure that it executes as often as possible 
    backgroundTask()
    
    #used to ensure that the firmware can move between screens
    if left.value() == 0:
      curScreen = "next screen name"
      GUIUPDATE = True
    if right.value() == 0:
      curScreen = "previus screen name"
      GUIUPDATE = True

ensure that you edit the code of the previus sceen to point to your new feature, ie 
    if left.value() == 0:
      curScreen = "next screen name"
      GUIUPDATE = True
would become 
    if left.value() == 0:
      curScreen = "SCREEN NAME HERE"
      GUIUPDATE = True
in the previus screen code 

the screen will not clear itself when switching screens 
you must call display.clear() to clear the screen
